## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I messed up a lot in display:flex property and changing images according to mobile and desktop sizes. but its kind of fun form me. Yet I'm not that much pro in Responsive coding, but who cares it was all fun.

### Continued development

I whould like to more focus on flex-box and css grid because its kind of giving control all over place.

### Useful resources
